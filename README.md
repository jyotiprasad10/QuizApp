The QuizApp has been totally made with React, Javascript, HTML and CSS. This app lets students answer MCQs and the lets them know their results along with feedback for the particular questions asked. The installation guide for this project has been given below for reference.

The App comes under the Level 1 of the task and covers the level 1 features.

The app has the basic App.js folder that is the start of every React application, this file will redirect you to the QuizApp component

In the QuizApp component we have used React Routing to route to two main components of the app
1. The Quiz Component
2. The Result Component.

The Quiz Component in short iterates over the questions array placed in the utils folder using the questions.js file. These questions are an array of objects that have the key and value pairs for the question along with the explanation and the correct answer.
This Quiz component then sends the score that is the total number of questions answered and unanswered to the result component which then displays the result, using the Result Component.

The Result component only recieves the score from the quiz component and the Explanation from the utils file and displays it to the user based on the answers he/she has chosen, this is the basic structure of the app.

The app has been hosted using Netlify and is easily accessible through the link - https://quiz-appjyotiprasad.netlify.app/result


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
